# JavaScript Polyfills

## What is a JavaScript Polyfill?

A JavaScript polyfill, often referred to simply as a "polyfill," is a piece of code that allows you to use new JavaScript features and APIs in older browsers that do not support them natively. Polyfills bridge the gap between modern code and older browsers, enabling developers to write code that works consistently across a wide range of browser versions.

## Why Should I Use Polyfills?
Using polyfills is essential for ensuring cross-browser compatibility. By using polyfills, you can take advantage of the latest JavaScript features without worrying about whether they are supported in older browsers. This helps you reach a broader audience and ensures a better user experience for all your website visitors.
